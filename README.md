# Multilevel Modeling of Infant Mortality in India
This paper studies Infant Mortality Rates (IMR's) in 30 Indian states and union territories from 2005 to 2014.  We identify state effects, time effects, and the impact of per-capita public health expenditure across states through Bayesian multilevel/hierarchical modeling. We validate our approach with posterior predictive checks. Once we control for state and time level variation explicitly, we find that percentage change in IMR with respect to percentage changes in per-capita health expenditure are small and negative (i.e they bring IMR down). Using partial pooling and weakly informative priors, we are able to obtain 30 different state-level coefficients measuring marginal effects of per-capita health expenditure on IMR. State level effects are varied and capturing this variation properly is a major breakthrough.  We also consider the differential nature of female and male infant mortality and highlight an anomalous trend in India where female infant mortality is consistently higher than male infant mortality for almost all states. We take this into account and analyze the relationship between per-capita health expenditure and IMR separately for females and males.
